## Execution Log

### 2026-02-14
- **M0-01** Completed fork hygiene initialization by configuring `upstream` remote to `microsoft/vscode` while keeping `origin` on the Pointer fork.  
  **Why:** establishes canonical upstream linkage required for merge policy and conflict-check automation.
- **M0-02** Verified required upstream tree roots exist: `src/`, `extensions/`, `product.json`, and `package.json`.  
  **Why:** confirms fork integrity before layering merge policy, CI checks, and Pointer-specific code.
- **M0-03** Recorded remote and branch tracking metadata in `docs/upstream-tracking.md`, including upstream default branch detection (`main`).  
  **Why:** creates an explicit, versioned reference for future merge operations and CI conflict detection steps.
