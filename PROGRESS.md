## Execution Log

### 2026-02-14
- **M0-01** Completed fork hygiene initialization by configuring `upstream` remote to `microsoft/vscode` while keeping `origin` on the Pointer fork.  
  **Why:** establishes canonical upstream linkage required for merge policy and conflict-check automation.
- **M0-02** Verified required upstream tree roots exist: `src/`, `extensions/`, `product.json`, and `package.json`.  
  **Why:** confirms fork integrity before layering merge policy, CI checks, and Pointer-specific code.
- **M0-03** Recorded remote and branch tracking metadata in `docs/upstream-tracking.md`, including upstream default branch detection (`main`).  
  **Why:** creates an explicit, versioned reference for future merge operations and CI conflict detection steps.
- **M0-04** Added `docs/upstream-merge-strategy.md` with merge cadence and rebase/merge branch policy.  
  **Why:** defines a stable operating model for keeping the fork current while minimizing long-term merge friction.
- **M0-05** Added `docs/upstream-merge-playbook.md` with executable sync commands and explicit conflict resolution policy.  
  **Why:** gives contributors a deterministic, repeatable upstream sync flow and reduces unsafe conflict handling.
- **M0-06** Added `.github/workflows/upstream-conflict-check.yml` to detect merge conflicts against `upstream/main` on PRs and a weekly schedule.  
  **Why:** surfaces upstream drift risk automatically before manual sync windows and shortens reaction time.
- **M0-07** Added `.github/workflows/smoke-launch.yml` to execute `./scripts/code.sh --version` on Linux and macOS after build/runtime setup.  
  **Why:** creates a fast cross-platform launch signal that catches broken dev startup paths early in CI.
