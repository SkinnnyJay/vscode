# Agents

Project agents are defined in **.cursor/agents**. See that directory for the canonical definitions.

**Subagent usage (Claude Code):** Invoke by name in prompts (e.g. "Use the root-cause-debugger to find why this fails"). Full index and when-to-use table: `.cursor/README.md` (Agent index). Agents reference skills in `.agents/skills/` and `.claude/skills/` and commands in `.cursor/commands/`.
