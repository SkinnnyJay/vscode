Pointer maintainers take security issues seriously and handle vulnerability reports with priority.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Use one of the private channels below:

1. **GitHub Security Advisories (preferred):** open a private report in the repository Security tab.
2. **Email:** `security@pointer.dev` with:
   - affected version/commit
   - reproduction steps or proof of concept
   - impact assessment
   - any suggested remediation

## Response targets

- Initial triage acknowledgment: **within 3 business days**
- Severity and impact assessment: **within 7 business days**
- Remediation timeline: communicated after triage based on risk and exploitability

## Scope

This policy covers Pointer-owned code in this repository, including:

- editor branding and packaging changes
- built-in Pointer extensions

Third-party dependencies and upstream Code - OSS issues may require coordinated disclosure with upstream maintainers.
